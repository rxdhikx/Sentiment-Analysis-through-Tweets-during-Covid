# Sentiment-Analysis-through-Tweets-during-Covid

Sentiment analysis has emerged as a significant tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its
significance lies in its ability to gauge public sentiments, emotions, and perceptions, offering
valuable insights into the evolving attitudes and concerns of people amidst the crisis â€“ all
through language/words used in the tweets made by an average user. This analysis assists in
tracking the shifts in public sentiment over time, aiding authorities in tailoring their responses
and strategies accordingly to address the changing needs and concerns of the population.

With so much info flying around during the pandemic, understanding how people feel helps
figure out what they think about different news and stuff. By doing this, we can spot where
there might be wrong or missing info that needs fixing. This is really important to help people
make good choices and stop wrong info from spreading.

When we check out how people share their feelings online during the pandemic, it helps us
see how it's impacting their mental health. This can tell us where people might need extra
support with their feelings.

For businesses, checking how people feel online is super important. It helps them change how
they sell things and make products that people really want during these hard times.
Even governments can use this to understand what people think about the rules and stuff
related to the pandemic. Knowing this helps them make better decisions based on what
people want.

When things are really tough, this way of understanding feelings helps find places or groups
of people who are feeling really bad. This way, help can go to those who need it most,
making it easier to help everyone during a crisis like the pandemic.

So, this kind of understanding feelings online has been a huge help in making decisions,
rules, and giving support during COVID-19.
